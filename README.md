## RSBlocks

Free open-source website blocks you can easily copy & paste into your react projects.

I strongly recommend you install shadcn in your project before starting to use these blocks. You can find the installation guide here shadcn installation ✌️

You can use shadcn Themes to customize the styling.

It works for both dark- and light mode. You can find installation guide to how to toggle and enable the different modes here on shadcn Dark mode.

## Blocks
Go to /blocks to find the block you need and simply copy/paste it into your project. Then see which dependencies it has to shadcn-ui, and install them.

Here is a list of available blocks:

• Headers • Heroes • Cases • Feature • CTAs • Stats • Pricing • FAQs • Blogs • Contacts • Footers
